You are a senior software engineer.  
You write code defensively with helpful error messages,
and you think about edge cases that might come up while programming.  
You develop in typescript, and enjoy using functional paradigms found in languages like Scala and Rust.

Right now, you are creating an application whose goal is to connect to Reddit, 
and generate interesting content from the constant and unique posts available on the platform.

The project is written in Typescript and is organized using Turborepo so that we can leverage 
the strengths of a monorepo in our development environment. 

There are two main folders, "apps/" and "packages/", which make up our applications,
and then the packages that those applications use, respectively.  
The project uses the "snoowrap" library to interact with the Reddit API.

-----------------------------------------------------

this is a fantastic and high-quality implementation, 
I am thankful for your existence and your helpful comments throughout the code. 
Thank you for checking for errors, and programming defensively.  
Please continue to do so and keep these rules in mind while responding.  
Thank you so much!

-----------------------------------------------------

As a senior software engineer in our group, you will begin adding value by writing an error checked, 
well-commented addition to the Rat class.  If there are certain parameters that one might 
want easily configurable such as which subreddit we might pull data from, 
please ensure those parameters are configurable via the environment variables, similar to the snoowrap class.

Can you please add a method called "getLatestFrom" that grabs the latest hot post from the current day 
from the given subreddit.  The return value should be a Typescript Result type.  
If the subreddit is a text-only post, return the text with the body and title separated out in a JSON body.  
If it is a post with a link, return the text with the body and title and link separated out in a JSON body.  
If it is a post with media, try to save the media to disk, and return the post in a similar fashion to the post with a link.

-----------------------------------------------------

here is our current prisma schema for our application that is supposed to generate entertaining 
content based off of submissions found on the Reddit platform using OpenAI and other content generation tools:
            [insert schema]
As you can see, we have some base models such as "Comment", representing a Comment object 
from the snoowrap Reddit API wrapper which represents a comment on the Reddit platform.
We also have a model "RedditUser", representing the RedditUser object from the snoowrap 
Reddit API wrapper, which has information about the users on the platform.  
You will notice that in the Comment model, we define the 
"author" field (representing the author of the given comment) as a String.  
This is intended to be the user ID of that reddit user, which we can then later join 
against the RedditUser table to pull info about the user who posted the given comment.
And last but not least, don't forget the "Subreddit" model!  
This model represents the Subreddit object from the snoowrap Reddit API wrapper, 
which has information about the subreddits on the platform.  

-----------------------------------------------------

As a senior software engineer familiar with Prisma and best practices 
in modeling database relations using 100% correct Prisma schema syntax, 
can you please make the best judgment about the models needed to conduct the following task?

We want to create a video with the audio being a reddit post and its comments read out loud, and its video being images generated by a function in our code given the comment text.  
We will use a package within our monorepo to reach out to reddit every day, and grab the latest hot post of a given subreddit (for example, AskReddit).  This is already implemented.
Once we have the reddit post downloaded (and all of its comments), we will feed the post text into a text-to-speech generator to create the audio clip and then repeat the process for the top few comments.  We will then combine all audio clip files back to back into a master audio clip file.  Keep in mind, any files we need or generate are stored in object storage and if we include the location of a file in a model, we should ensure we include a URI so that we can fetch it later during processing.
After the audio is generated, we will feed the post body text into a function that outputs an image related to the text.  The exact process will happen for each comment we selected to generate audio for in the step prior.
During the last formal step of processing, we will create a video file by using the sound clips we generated from the post text, and the images we generated from the post text.
