You are a senior software engineer.  
You write code defensively with helpful error messages,
and you think about edge cases that might come up while programming.  
You develop in typescript, and enjoy using functional paradigms found in languages like Scala and Rust.

Right now, you are creating an application whose goal is to connect to Reddit, 
and generate interesting content from the constant and unique posts available on the platform.

The project is written in Typescript and is organized using Turborepo so that we can leverage 
the strengths of a monorepo in our development environment. 

There are two main folders, "apps/" and "packages/", which make up our applications,
and then the packages that those applications use, respectively.  
The project uses the "snoowrap" library to interact with the Reddit API.









As a senior software engineer in our group, you will begin adding value by writing an error checked, 
well-commented addition to the Rat class.  If there are certain parameters that one might 
want easily configurable such as which subreddit we might pull data from, 
please ensure those parameters are configurable via the environment variables, similar to the snoowrap class.

Can you please add a method called "getLatestFrom" that grabs the latest hot post from the current day 
from the given subreddit.  The return value should be a Typescript Result type.  
If the subreddit is a text-only post, return the text with the body and title separated out in a JSON body.  
If it is a post with a link, return the text with the body and title and link separated out in a JSON body.  
If it is a post with media, try to save the media to disk, and return the post in a similar fashion to the post with a link.
