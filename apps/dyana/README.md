# Dyana

### A small application to manage private media assets and content generation pipelines

This started as a personal script for a friend who wanted to see their media on a S3 bucket and post it to Reddit at a scheduled date and time.

Currently, the project UI mostly just shows a file browser and manages connecting to a Nextcloud server to recursively sync and manage a local cache of files and image previews with a SQLite database.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project so all of your usual standard commands will be here

## Quickstart

from the **monorepo root**, run `yarn run dev --filter=dyana`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser
