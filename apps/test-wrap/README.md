# test-wrap

### A useless package for messing about with this monorepo, building out new scripts and functionality, and offering a playground

> NOTE: this is not a repo where things can be merged/deleted willy-nilly, it is more like a communal test-ground. Please treat it with the same respect and dignity as we would any other repo. 🙏
