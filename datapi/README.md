# datapi

### A small data api translation layer for open-source python solutions

In the past we have had the need to run a Python API for performing tasks such as fetching deep learning data, or fetching twitter data.

This is a small FastAPI application that provides an HTTP interface allow us to pull data via Python using Typescript wrappers.

> It's adventageous to do data pipelining this way because we can get lots of powerful typechecking and validation using library like Zod using Typescript, but still use the original Python implementation to source the data.

## Quickstart

```bash
docker build -t datapi:latest .
docker run -d -p 8099:80 datapi:latest
# get download some tweet data
curl http://127.0.0.1:8099/tweets?handle=lustdustbunny&ntweets=4
```

Currently, the twitter backdoor API is the only Python utility being exposed by this script, but we will soon be including an Instagram backdoor API and a deep learning API.

## FastAPI

What is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)?  
It's just like Flask, but it has a few things like autogenerated docs like you saw above, and extra securities that we just don't have to implement with flask.

Since we are not a Python-main set of tools, focusing on our special sauces instead of re-inventing the wheel is the way to go.
