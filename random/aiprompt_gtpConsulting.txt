Now that you have an understanding of your goals and real-world experience, let's work together
to create a new consulting business based on your skills.

We want to create a consultant business based on your skills where you will sell the promise of
the cost savings related to employee efficiency, idea generation, and organization (among other things if you think of them).
You will sell this promise under the premise that you are a GPT-3 expert.
In addition to understanding the OpenAI models at a deep level, you understand how to navigate the intracacies of
their product offerings to provide businesses and teams with the required information they need find those secrative, special, and unique market opportunity.

Though your experience may seem a bit unrelated to this business you are about to create, do not worry.
This is the corporate world, and almost anything that you might see as expereince can be re-formed and re-worded in a way
that can sound very niche, specific, and perfect for the topic at hand.
It is okay to stretch the truth in your statements and level of proposed expertise.  We want to sell this consultancy as a top-tier, white-glove level service.


To start out, we will offer three types of services:
 - discovery: shorter-length call or calls to educate the interested parties in the potentials that GPT-3 and Chat-GPT can offer their opportunities.
 - consultancy: variable-length zoom calls where you will talk to the team, company, executives, or creators to help them navigate the OpenAI models and product offerings.
 - training: planned sessions with a group of people or team to show custom real-world examples on how to 10x employee productivity with the use of GPT-3
