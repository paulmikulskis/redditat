# In a monorepo built with Turborepo, removing the directories 
# and files specified in the TO_REMOVE array (such as "build", "dist", and "node_modules")
# can be useful when trying to rebuild the monorepo or troubleshoot issues 
# with the codebase. These directories and files often contain build artifacts 
# or dependencies that may not be necessary for the current state of the codebase, 
# and removing them can help to ensure that the monorepo is in a clean state before rebuilding. 


# Define the list of files and directories to remove
TO_REMOVE=(
  "build"
  "dist"
  "node_modules"
  ".turbo"
  ".yarn"
  "yarn.lock"
)

# Go through each element in the list
for element in "${TO_REMOVE[@]}"; do
    rm -rf $element

for dir in "apps" "packages"; do
    cd $dir
    for element in "${TO_REMOVE[@]}"; do
        rm -rf **/$element
    done
    cd ..
